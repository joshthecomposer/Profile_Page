This assignment taught me a lot about how to compartmentalize my thought process in a web layout, so that each section of the page can be thought of as it's own object. I think I could clean up some of the html and use a few less divs overall, but this is a great start and I learned a lot. I will go back to my previous personal projects and update them with the skills I have honed and through my tinkering and testing.
