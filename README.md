# Profile Page Exercise
### This was an assignment that was completed for Web Fundamentals at Coding Dojo

Objective: Create a profile page using the given wireframe below:

<img src="img/reference.png" width="500">

### Positive Takeaways:

This assignment taught me a lot about how to compartmentalize my thought process in a web layout, so that each section of the page can be thought of as it's own object. I think I could clean up some of the html and use a few less divs overall, but this is a great start and I learned a lot. I will go back to my previous personal projects and update them with the skills I have honed through my tinkering and testing.

### Areas I could Improve:

While I used some responsive elements such as `display: flex` to organize my divs, I could play with more responsive functionality. One example would be collapsing the right sidebar elements into a thin column comprised of simple icons or user profile pictures (similar to what Facebook currently does with it's left navbar). Another possibility would be to play with `flex-wrap`, causing the sidebar elements to simply stack under the main elements.
